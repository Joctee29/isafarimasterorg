# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive Google Sign-In authentication and onboarding flow that requires users to select their role (Traveler or Service Provider) before completing registration. The system ensures role selection happens once at registration, persists across sessions, and is reliably used for access control, user experience, and admin management.

## Glossary

- **Authentication_System**: The backend service responsible for user authentication, token generation, and session management
- **Role_Selection_UI**: The frontend component that displays role options (Traveler/Service Provider) to users during Google Sign-In registration
- **User_Database**: The PostgreSQL database storing user accounts with role information
- **Google_OAuth_Handler**: The backend service that processes Google OAuth callbacks and manages Google user data
- **Admin_Dashboard**: The administrative interface for viewing and managing all registered users
- **JWT_Token**: JSON Web Token used for authenticating API requests after login
- **Dashboard_Router**: The frontend routing logic that directs users to appropriate dashboards based on role

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Role Selection Before Google Authentication

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to select my account type (Traveler or Service Provider) before completing Google Sign-In, so that my role is established from the start.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Sign up with Google" THEN THE Role_Selection_UI SHALL display two role options: Traveler and Service Provider
2. WHILE the role selection screen is displayed THE Authentication_System SHALL prevent Google OAuth initiation until a role is selected
3. WHEN a user attempts to proceed without selecting a role THEN THE Role_Selection_UI SHALL display an error message requiring role selection
4. WHEN a user selects a role and clicks continue THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL store the selected role in session storage before initiating Google OAuth
5. THE Role_Selection_UI SHALL display clear descriptions for each role option to help users make informed decisions

### Requirement 2: Role Persistence During OAuth Flow

**User Story:** As a user completing Google Sign-In, I want my role selection to be preserved throughout the OAuth process, so that my account is created with the correct role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google OAuth callback is received THE Google_OAuth_Handler SHALL retrieve the role selection from session storage
2. IF the role selection is missing from session storage THEN THE Google_OAuth_Handler SHALL redirect the user back to role selection
3. WHEN creating a new Google user account THE User_Database SHALL store the user_type field with the selected role value
4. WHEN a Google user account is created THE Authentication_System SHALL link the Google UID to the user record permanently
5. THE User_Database SHALL store the authentication provider type (google) for each Google-authenticated user

### Requirement 3: Role-Based Dashboard Redirection

**User Story:** As a returning user, I want to be automatically redirected to my appropriate dashboard after Google Sign-In, so that I don't have to navigate manually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an existing Google user signs in THE Authentication_System SHALL retrieve their stored role from the database
2. WHEN a user with role "traveler" completes authentication THEN THE Dashboard_Router SHALL redirect to the traveler dashboard
3. WHEN a user with role "service_provider" completes authentication THEN THE Dashboard_Router SHALL redirect to the service provider dashboard
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL NOT prompt existing users to select a role on subsequent logins
5. WHEN authentication completes THE JWT_Token SHALL include the user's role for frontend authorization

### Requirement 4: Admin User Management View

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view all registered users with their roles and authentication methods, so that I can manage the user base effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Admin_Dashboard SHALL display a list of all registered users with their assigned roles
2. WHEN displaying user records THE Admin_Dashboard SHALL show a badge or indicator for users who signed up via Google
3. THE Admin_Dashboard SHALL allow filtering users by role (Traveler, Service Provider)
4. THE Admin_Dashboard SHALL allow filtering users by authentication method (Google, Email/Password)
5. WHEN viewing user details THE Admin_Dashboard SHALL display the user's Google email if authenticated via Google

### Requirement 5: Secure Role Storage

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user roles to be securely stored and immutable after registration, so that users cannot change their role without admin intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Database SHALL store user roles in a non-nullable column with valid values constrained to 'traveler' or 'service_provider'
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL NOT allow users to modify their own role after account creation
3. WHEN a user attempts to access a dashboard not matching their role THEN THE Dashboard_Router SHALL redirect them to their correct dashboard
4. THE Admin_Dashboard SHALL provide functionality for admins to view user roles but role changes require explicit admin action
5. IF a database integrity error occurs during role storage THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL rollback the user creation and display an error

### Requirement 6: Future Authentication Provider Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to be extensible, so that additional OAuth providers can be added in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE User_Database SHALL store authentication provider information in a dedicated column (auth_provider)
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL use a provider-agnostic interface for OAuth authentication flows
3. WHEN adding a new OAuth provider THE Authentication_System SHALL require only configuration changes without modifying core authentication logic
4. THE User_Database SHALL support linking multiple authentication methods to a single user account
5. THE Role_Selection_UI SHALL be reusable for any OAuth provider requiring role selection

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options if something goes wrong during Google Sign-In, so that I can complete registration successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF Google OAuth fails THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL display a user-friendly error message with retry option
2. IF role selection data is lost during OAuth THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL redirect to role selection with preserved Google data
3. IF database connection fails during user creation THEN THE Authentication_System SHALL display an error and allow retry
4. WHEN an error occurs THE Authentication_System SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. THE Role_Selection_UI SHALL provide a "Back to Login" option for users who want to cancel registration
